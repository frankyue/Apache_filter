A module of Apache_filter 
------------------------------
Function:
	1.To filter any words you want to
	2.Filter works in different websites(Directories)!

Idea:
	All of the words' binary in UTF-8,Unicode,GB2312 code are the same for the apache server!By this idea I can filter all of the words which get through the apache server!

Continue:
	It is not finish!I just finish to filter the words which were written in the filter file include all encodes!
	If you want to filter all encodes of words,just get the webpage's encode and convert the file's words' encode to your webpages!Filter can work on!

Attention:
	Remember the compiler's ruler ,the source code was written in linux and compiled sucessful by the GCC(Gcc has no need to declare the variable at first then to use it!).
