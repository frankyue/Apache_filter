A module of Apache_filter 
------------------------------
I write a module of apache to filter any words you want!
All of the words' binary in UTF-8,Unicode,GB2312 code are the same for the apache server!By this idea I can filter all of the words which get through the apache server!

It is not finish!I just finish to filter the words which were written in the filter file include all encodes!
Just get the webpage's encode and convert the file's words' encode to your webpages!Filter can work on!
